To make sure everyone is able to commit at least something to the project we are going to change how duties in the project 
are delegated.  Anyone can pick a handful of requirements that they can fulfill themselves by going onto the sprint board and dragging
anything on the "To-Do" list to "In Progress".  

For instance, if I wanted to do requirements 1-3 on the project I'll take drag these requirements from "To-Do" to "In Progress" as you move
the note over make sure that you put your name at the bottom of the note so we know who is working on what.

Anyone with questions can ask on the groupchat.
